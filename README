mbp-encode: creates a METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE structure from an image file
mbp-decode: extracts information and binary data from a METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE structure

The METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE structure is defined at:

	https://xiph.org/flac/format.html#metadata_block_picture.

It is used to embed cover pictures inside music files, such as MP3 and OGG Vorbis.

I created these tools because I could not find any command-line tools to
embed images into OGG Vorbis files and/or extract embedded images from them.
mbp-encode and mbp-decode can be used in combination with vorbiscomment
(from vorbis-tools) and other Linux utilities to perform this task.

To embed an image into a Vorbis file use:

	$ printf "METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE=" > <temp_file>
	$ mbp-encode <image_file> -t <type> | base64 -w 0 >> <temp_file>
	$ vorbiscomment <vorbis_file> -a -c <temp_file>

where <type> is usually 3, which means "front cover" (for other values, see "mbp-encode -h").

To extract an embedded image from a Vorbis file, use:

	$ vorbiscomment <vorbis_file> | grep METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE= | cut -d = -f 2- \
		| base64 -d | mbp-decode -p -o <image_file>
